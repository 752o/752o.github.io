> George Miller, known professionally as [Joji](youtube.com/@Joji) and formerly [Pink Guy](https://www.youtube.com/@TVFilthyFrank), is a Japanese singer-songwriter, rapper, comedian, and former Youtuber. Aside from the comedic and often rap-based music he created under the Pink Guy alias, Miller also created more serious and traditional music under the stage name, Joji, which became his primary focus in the late 2017.

> Another top rated song from Joji is **Slow Dancing in the Dark** which currently has 969,340,860 plays on Spotify. In "Slow Dancing in the Dark", Joji continues the loveborn narrative from his previous single "[YEAH RIGHT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-i91hR6ljQ)" over a dark, ambient instrumental. This time around, he uses the metaphor of *slow dancing in the dark* to characterize a failing relationship - just like a slow dance where you can't see your partner's face, his relationship with this person is intimate but ultimately impersonal.

> However, one of my personal favorite music from Joji is called **Glimpse of Us**, In this track, this individual talks about how he compares his current relationship to the connection he felt with a past lover, unable to forget the feelings he had in his past, showing how destructive it can get without your presence in my life.
